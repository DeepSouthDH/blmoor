## About the project

This website is a testimony to the persistent efforts of the East Oktibbeha County community over the years to support their educational opportunities and successes. Without the endurance and commitment from so many individuals, this story would not have been possible.

## Credits

This website is a project of the EAEOCS, lead by Jacqueline Ellis. The images in the collection and much of the research of BL Moor's history comes from her personal collection. Jackie is also in part responsible for writing some of the commemorative text of the site.

Parker Haley is a graduate of Mississippi State University, and he scanned, compiled, and wrote the text for the site. Hillary Richardson is an Associate Professor and Coordinator of Undergraduate Research at Mississippi University for Women, and she provided oversight for the project.

Scanning equipment, web development, and funding were provided by Deep South DH, a collaboration between Mississippi University for Women and Millsaps College. This project was also made possible by a grant from the Mississippi Humanities Council, through support from the National Endowment for the Humanities. Any views, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this website do not necessarily represent those of the National Endowment for the Humanities or the Mississippi Humanities Council.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from https://github.com/DeepSouthDH/blmoor.
