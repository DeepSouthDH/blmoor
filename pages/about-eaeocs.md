# Who is EAEOCS?

The Education Association of East Oktibbeha County Schools became a state registered organization in 2001 whenever 18 B.L. Moor graduates determined there was a need for a group that could improve and aid the school's exterior and the students' day-to-day lives. Since 2015, EAEOCS has remained active in preserving the school's history and encouraging alumni correspondence and appreciation. The private non-profit organization is designated to help the community and has achieved and remained compliant with all federal eligibility requirements for 20 years and counting. 

The Education Association of East Oktibbeha County Schools is an ongoing collaboration of BL Moor and East Oktibbeha County HS alumni, lead in part by Jacqueline Ellis, to bring awareness to the school's history, to engage in community activities, and to provide opportunities to Oktibbeha County students. The continued successes of this organization are accredited to the alumni's preserverance, dedication, loyalty, and appreciation during and after their educational journeys.
