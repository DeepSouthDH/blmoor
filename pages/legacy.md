# Beginnings

Prior to 1960, several small, community schools educated Black students of all ages in southeast Oktibbeha county. These one-to-two room community church schools included Pleasant Grove, St. Matthews, Austin, Truevine, Pine Grove, Zion Franklin, Mt. Olivet, and Bethel. Various church schools in Oktibbeha county, including Pleasant Grove and Truevine, were built with the help of Julius Rosenwald <!--include hyperlink-->, a Chicago businessman and philanthropist who sympathized with the injustices Black Americans faced. These schools were also affiliated with local churches that provided the appropriate resources and land for the construction of the schoolhouses. 

Rosenwald, alongside Booker T. Washington, found providing schools in the rural south would be one way of giving Blacks a fair chance at equal citizenship, something that would be for the "well-being of mankind," as his charter stated. After the first schoolhouse <!--first schoolhouse in Okt county or anywhere?--> was completed in 1913, Rosenwald went on to spend $4.02 million to build 4,762 Rosenwald schools across the 14 southern states by 1930 before ending his and Washington's "Plan for Erection of Rural Schoolhouses" in 1932.

Rosenwald was not alone in his monetary contributions, as Black parents consistently illustrated their committment in providing education for their children by matching Rosenwald's contributions to build, maintain, and provide for these schools. In fact, southern Blacks of the 14 southern states donated $90,848.25 in 1930-1931, and in 1932-33, amidst the Great Depression, Black Mississippians raised $1,965 <!--cite figures-->. These donations cannot be understated.  Studies show only rural Blacks who were primarily tenants and sharecroppers could earn beyond what was needed for bare necessities, as the average annual income for a Black family in 1934 was $105.43<!--cite figure-->. In addition to their monetary donations, rural Black communities donated their land, materials, time, and labor to construct these schools, hoping to gain educational equity amid numerous hindrances such as segregation, disenfranchisement, and White supremacy.  

One major hindrance resided in Mississippi legislation, for despite Black families paying local taxes for schools their children could not attend, the law prohibited the board of education from expending any funds on construction projects unless the county had its own tax levy for building projects, and  White schools had precedence due to racial discrimimation; however, in 1930, Mississippi state officials successfully advocated for a school law revision, allowing local taxes to be allocated for African American projects. But even before the new legislation, in 1924, Black contributions were evident, as one of the three public high schools for Blacks at the time, Mount Bayou, was built solely from Black contributions—$115,000<!--cite source here-->. Time after time, Black Mississippians displayed resilience and fortitude to improve their educational opportunities.

By 1930, the monetary contributions of Rosenwald and Black families had already made an impact on Black education in Mississippi, as they had extended the average length of their school years by 3.9 months from 1915 and dropped their illiteracy rate from 76% in 1880 to 19.7% and to 8.9% by 1950<!--cite figures-->. Although Rosenwald schools had increased their terms by nearly 4 months, schools such as southeast Oktibbeha's Pleasant Grove high school still had to cut the year short due to students having to help provide food and income for the families.

<!--add *Race and Schooling in the South* chart on illiteracy percentages-->

Despite these challenges, local educators in these community schools made attending school possible, before and after Rosenwald's involvement. D.R. "Dock" Rives<!--link to page?-->, whose father was enslaved and forbidden to learn how to read and write, served southeast Oktibbeha as a local educator. Dock, just one generation after the Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil War, went on to educate Black youth from 1900-1950 at McGee, Bethel, Turnpike, and others; furthermore, Dock's grandaughter, Lillie Rives Ellis<!--link to page?--> also educated students at community schools throughout the 50s, creating a family tradition of educators. Educators who had overwhelming odds stacked against them, like Mr. Rives and Mrs. Ellis, are the ones who made such educational improvements throughout the 20th century possible. 

By 1932, the year of Rosenwald's death, he had built 4,762 schools across the 14 southern states, 557 of them being in Mississippi. In addition to schools, Rosenwald aided trasnportation by providing bus services in rural areas like southeast Oktibbeha county. Despite these tremendous efforts from Rosenwald and Black communities, 1,428 of Mississippi's 3,737 public schools for Blacks still met in private buildings such as barns, lodges, tenant cabins, and churches in 1934, something that would remain unchanged until the *Brown v Board* ruling in 1954.

Although Rosenwald had died, Black education in Mississippi continued to thrive with improvement and local involvement. For example, only 32% of Black teachers in Greensboro held a college degree in 1932, but by 1952, all Black teachers held a college degree, with 65% earning a Master's degree. Furthermore, Black colleges doubled their enrollement in 1940s, increasing their income from $8 million in 1930 to $38 million in 1947 (Klarman, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1073592">"Brown, Racial Change, and the Civil Rights Movement,"</a> p. 66).

# Southeast Oktibbeha Community Schools

## Pleseant Grove

Pleasant Grove was a community school that was built between 1927-1928, adjacent to Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, taking the place of "New Prospect," a school that had been around since at least 1900. For over 30 years, Pleasant Grove served as the High School for other communities in southeast Oktibbeha county, such as Zion Franklin, Pine Grove, St. Matthew, Turnpike, Mt. Olivet, McGee, Austin, and Bethel, which only educated students until 8th grade. Managed by local trustees and a supervisor who oversaw all community church schools, Pleasant Grove resided just <!--number?--> miles from where B.L. Moor would be constructed years later. In total, the estimated cost of the Pleasant Grove project was $200,000, something Rosenwald and parents contributed to equally. The building contained five classrooms and an auditorium which was used for two classrooms. Additionally, state records <!--cite?--> claim the building had electricity, coal stoves, pit toilets, drinking fountains, a deep well, and an electric pump. While attending the school, male students were responsible for janitorial services, as well as cutting and kindling the fire to maintain sustainable temperatures. 

Furthermore, students could be seen playing marbles underneath the school where they had dug holes, or basketball on the grass nearby. The school desired a football team and Mississippi State donated equipment to do so, but the inability to find a suitable and safe location to practice and play suspended that possibility until the late 1960s.

### Other Community Schools Prior to 1960

{% include feature/image.html objectid="blmoor139" width="50" %}

Austin was affiliated with the Church of Christ denomination in the Sessums community. According to MDAH, it served as an eighth grade center with one teacher, but former students recall both Ms. Emma Conley and Ms. Hattie Spencer teaching at the location. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="blmoor127" width="50" %}

Bethel, located on Bethel M.B. Church property, was also an eighth-grade center with one story frame structure with a metal roof containing two classrooms and two teachers. Appliances included electricity, a coal stove, outdoor toilets, and good furniture but lacked accessibility to water. Bethel served as a community center for functions such as cake walks, feasts, and educational fundraisers for the community. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="blmoor126" width="50" %}

Chapel Hill School was an eigth grade center on church property of modern day Harris Road in Starkville, Mississippi. This one story, one classroom building possessed electricity, an outdoor toilet, and a coal stove but no water.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="blmoor136" width="50" %}

McGee was located on 10 acres of land near the current Pike and Spruill intersection in southern Starkville, Mississippi. The eighth grade, one story, one classroom structure had a metal roof with outdoor toilets, and a coal  stove. It is unknown whether the school had a community church affiliation, but the teachers noted were Mrs. Willie Adams, her aunts Idella Minor, and Willie Dora Dickerson. 

{% include feature/image.html objectid="blmoor137" width="50" %}

Pine Grove was an eighth grade center built across from Pine Grove Baptist Church on Bluff Lake Road road, near the Bluff Lake reservoir. The one story, one classroom structure had a metal roof. The last two teachers noted were Mrs. Martha Bibbs and Ms. Thelma Roberson, and the common last names that attended this school were Rice, Ellis, McGee, Mobley, Nicholas, Brown, Edward, Moore, Spearmon, and Gillespie. And despite the various last names listed, Pine Grove served a small community; many students were commuting from other parts of the county and were not immediately part of the community.   

{% include feature/image.html objectid="blmoor124" width="50" %}

True Vine, the only other Rosenwald school in southeast Oktibbeha, was located west of Artesia on modern day Artesia Road. The two teachers were Mr. Glenn Elliot and Mrs. Elsie Mosley. 

Turnpike school was an eighth grade center with one story, two classrooms, and a metal roof on the modern day dead end of Pike Road in southern Starkville, Mississippi; the land belonged to Zion Franklin United Methodist Church. It had electricity, good furniture, coal stoves, outdoor toilets, and watern from a cistern. Ms. Thelma Robinson, who also taught at Pine Grove, was recalled as teaching at the location. 

St. Matthew was located on church property near Artesia, Mississippi. It was a one story, one classroom with a tin roof. Before conditions became too poor to continue operation, there was electricity, a coal stove, and outdoor toilets. The two teachers noted were Mrs. Beatrice Jerry and Mrs. Idella Minor.

# The Legacy of B.L. Moor 

In 1953, former Governor Hugh White called Legislature into extraordinary session and eventually mandated that all Mississippi school districts be reconstituited and reorganized; consequently, in 1959, construction for the Pleasant Grove and Rock Hill Projects began. The Rock Hill Project, named after another communtiy school, became known as Alexander Middle School, while the Pleasant Grove Project was named B.L. Moor, despite the local community's desire to retain the name "Pleasant Grove." 

<!--MDAH-->  

Between Governor Hugh's mandate and the construction of B.L. Moor, the Supreme Court passed *Brown v Board of Education*,<!--link to something about BvB. MS Encyclopedia entry https://mississippiencyclopedia.org/entries/brown-v-board-of-education/ ? Something on Rosenwald and BvB https://savingplaces.org/stories/rosenwald-fellows-and-the-journey-to-brown-v-board-of-education ?--> a monumental ruling that stated separating children in public schools on the basis of race was "inherently unequal" and unconstituitional. Integration, however, was virtually non-existent a decade later, as not a single Black child attended an integrated public school by 1963 and only 1.2% of Black students were integrated by 1964. It was not until after various pieces of legislation were enacted did change occur. These include the 1964 Civil Rights Act<!--link to original?--> that threatened to cut off federal educational funding for segregated school districts, as well as the funding for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1966. Additonally, the Supreme Court's decisions in *Green v. County School Board of New Kent County* (Virginia, 1968)<!--hyperlink citation--> and *Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education* (Mississippi, 1969)<!--hyperlink citation--> helped put an official end to segregation.

<!--Brown v. Board, add Sun_Herald_(26-09-57).jpg (?)-->

B.L. Moor's student body, although desegregated, remained entirely Black. A large part of this was due to White flight, for many southerners remained refractory to legislation, causing 115 new private instituitions to appear in the state, such as Starkville Academy. As the charts show below, private school enrollment in Mississippi nearly tripled between 1967 and 1972. Astoundingly, before the final consolidation of East Oktibbeha County High School (which  B.L. Moor consolidated into in 2002) into Starkville Oktibbeha schools in 2016, the county school was still over 90% Black, while Starkville Academy was well over 90% White.

Regardless of the social inequalities, B.L. Moor students were excited about the opening of the school in 1960. They looked forward to indoor toilets, hot meals, the new gymnasium for basketball, and not having to cut wood for heat. Early on, numerous students still had to walk to school, but those from Crawford had bus transportation. 

This original building had numerous classrooms, a home economics department, a business center, a library, and cafeteria. One of the most memorable elements of the building was a hallway that extended a considerable distance and was divided into three sections to accomodate all grades K-12. One student who attended on the opening day recalls their experience of the new facilities, saying, "Can you imagine? The hall was well waxed [and] long. As one stepped inside the front entrance [there] was a huge gymnasium with a sparkling wood-stained basketball court. Behind it was a stage that would be used for general assembly, special programs, or other unique events in the community."  <!--can we provide more info or a link for who said this?-->
