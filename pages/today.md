# Today's Efforts

This page gives information concerning what efforts are being taken by the Education Association of East Oktibbeha County Schools (EAEOCS) to remain active in the community despite the consolidation that occurred in 2015 that brought an end to B.L. Moor. 

This page will allow you to find past and upcoming events, ways of helping and/or participating, and contact information for anyone interested. 

# Who is EAEOCS?

The Education Association of East Oktibbeha County Schools became a state registered organization in 2001 whenever 18 B.L. Moor graduates determined there was a need for a group that could improve and aid the school where necessary, including the student's day-to-day lives. Since 2015, EAEOCS has remained active in preserving the school's history and encouraging alumni correspondence and appreciation. The private non-profit organization designated to help the community has achieved and remained in congruence with all federal eligibility requirements for 20 years and counting. 

The continued successes of this organization are accredited to the alumni's preserverance, dedication, loyalty, and appreciation during and after their educational journeys. 

## EAEOCS Projects and Events

The initial objectives included improving the landscape, creating and hosting biennial school reunions, participating in school activities, aiding students with scholarships, and providing health education for Oktibbeha county communities. 

After tragic news that arson had damaged B.L. Moor on April 6, 2002, EAEOCS and alumni readily responded by volunteering to help fix the damages. Furthermore, EAEOCS put on their first fundraiser by having alumni, former staff and faculty, companies and organizations, churches, and others sponsor bricks in the courtyard, a display that remains there despite the loss of the section 16 land.

Once the Oktibbeha County School Board approved EAEOCS's request to making landscape improvements around the school, EAEOCS organized another fundraiser by hosting a banquet on June 11th, 2004, where alumni of '81 and NFL Hall of Famer Jerry Rice attended guest speaker, recalling the educational "foundation" B.L. Moor gave him. At the completion of EAEOCS's fundraising efforts, Rice donated $30,000 to help kickstart the project, saying it was just his way of repaying gratitude. 

On June 12th, 2004, a day after the banquet, EAEOCS, with financial assistance from local churches and the local governement, hosted a picnic named "A Village of Fun" at East Oktibbeha County High School (formerly named B.L. Moor). The event brought together 75 B.L. Moor alumni dating back to 1950, as well as contemporary students and administrators to promote community involvement with education. As such, Sharqular Hart was awarded with EAEOCS's first scholarship of $300, and former superintendent [# Dr. Walter Conley] and former principal Albert Williams commented their appreciation for EAEOCS's efforts and outlook. The event also provided food, playground activities, contests, and other forms of entertainement that both alumni and students could enjoy.

With the approval of the Oktibbeha County Board of Supervisors, district supervisor George Curry Jr. assisted EAEOCS with the landscaping project, which began on Novemeber 3rd, 2007. Citizens of the community and students alike helped with the project over a series of workdays that were scheduled through the proceeding months.

The project consisted of laying sod, planting shrubbery, and trees, but additional efforts included removing the area where mobile classrooms once stood and clearing the wooded area along the driveway. With the help of teachers like English teacher Ms. Wright, such projects were intertwined with service learning requirements, allowing students to either receive credit or community service hours for assisting with the project.

An ampitheater, or "outdoor classroom," was another project EAEOCS advocated for proceding the arson in 2002. After nearly 6 years of collaboration with school alumni, community partners, the Carl Small Town Center, and Mississippi State College of Architecture, the $110,000 project was completed April 18th, 2008, where EOCHS students, teachers, alumni, county school officials, and community supporters gathered for the ribbon cutting ceremony.

EAEOCS's ampitheater project provided students with unique learning opportunities, helped bridge the gap between merged school entities, and gave EOCHS and the surrounding community a sense of pride and ownership in their school and the education received there. Addiitonally, the project brought together various organizations, programs, and people together "who would not necessarily have come together,"  said Jim West, the dean of Mississippi State School of Architecture in 2008.

# Reunions

EAEOCS has also made conscious efforts of keeping B.L. Moor alumni from 1960 to 2015 connected through reunions regardless of where they are today. Jimmy Blair (Class of '64) ignited the idea in 2006 when he organized a reunion in St. Louis that had approximately 100 attendees. The event provided food and games before making its way to the community center where additional socializing occurred. Amid the event, the plan for a more widespread reunion in the following year developed. Hence, in 2007, now in Starkville, another reunion occurred across a three day period in which 350 alumni across 15 different states gathered. The 2007 reunion saw the formation of a reunion committee who would develop reunions biennially; this committe is now a component of EAEOCS. 

The tradition has continued since 2007. From 2009-2019, the reunions were held at various places, such as the Starkville Shrine Building, EOCHS, Travis Outlaw Center, Starkville Sportplex, and McKee Park. These reunions continue to provide food and games for all, but they also honor former coaches, teachers, and students and have various alumni and administrators ranging across the years speak on behalf of their school experiences. 

The reunions have seen different themes through the years, such as "Born to Soar," "Soaring Past, Pressent, and Future," "A Change Has Come," and "Reunited... It Feels So Good."

# Reclaiming Efforts

On the same day B.L. Moor was officially consolidated, Memorial Day in 2015, EAEOCS decided to advocate for the property so they could provide the local community with resources such as educational tutoring and mentoring, health and wellness, and other practical services for career and professional development. 

# Mississippi Landmark Designation

Despite being unable to reclaim a portion of section 16 land, EAEOCS successfully advocated for a Mississippi Landmark to be placed on the property. Mississippi Department of Archives & History (MDAH), who approves and designates these markers across the state, affirms the level of preservation and commemoration such a landmark signifies, saying, "[Mississippi Landmark](https://tinyurl.com/25wsdwcr) designation is the highest form of recognition bestowed on properties by the state of Mississippi. It offers the fullest protection against changes that might alter a property's historic character." 

On Juneteenth 2023, the marker's unveiling (see below) accumulated roughly 30 to 40 individuals.[# Ms. Jacqueline "Jackie" Ellis], [# Dr. Walter Conley], Reverend Willie E. Thomas, Reverend Tyrone Stallings, and MDAH Director of Programs and Communication W. Brother Rogers all made comments on the marker's historical relevance and meaning.
